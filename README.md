**[News](https://vendettatvv.github.io/News/)** - is my project in `React.js`. This project helps to find news on various topics using the API.

**API documentation** https://newsapi.org/ - website that allows you to make up to 100 requests daily for free. To receive data, you need to register on the site and obtain an API key.

To build the application I use ready-made components from `react-bootstrap` - free set of tools for creating websites and web applications.

To manage the state of the application, I used the library `react-redux`. This library contains tools to greatly simplify the transfer of data through the context.

The application router is a module `react-router`, which contains the main functionality for working with routing. In work with the browser, I use the module `react-router-dom`, by wrapping the components in `App.js`.
